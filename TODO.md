Tools:
- React
- Bootstrap and Sass

1. Build Navbar
  - ~~First setup the stars background~~
  - ~~Use React router and Navbar component~~
    - ~~BrowserRouter goes in Main.jsx~~
    - ~~Get the 2 routes working then do the rest of the pages~~
    - ~~Navbar component gets the Link tags~~
    - ~~Pick CSS framework (Bootstrap and Sass)~~
    - ~~Make hamburger menu to start~~
  - ~~Style burger menu to mockup~~
  - ~~Let the Navbar component be DRY~~
  - ~~Double check routing functionality~~
  - ~~Make responsive~~
  - Refactor

2. Build out Mercury page
  - ~~Extract the info from data.json~~
  - ~~Start with just the image (this should work for each planet page)~~
  - Pull the rest of the data starting from 'Overview'
  - Create buttons for 1 overview, 2 structure, and 3 surface. 
    - May have to dive into routing. 
    - Possibilty of conditional rendering for 2 and 3
    - Make it its own component? or It's own routing on each planet component?
  - Ideally, you could render each planet info dynamically rather than hard coding each page. The multiple pages are generally a placeholder
